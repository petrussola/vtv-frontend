- Repo is deplyed at www.socvtv.fun
- Vilafranca is a town located 50km south of Barcelona. It happens to be my hometown.
- There is a joke that says that if you have done the most local possible things to do you are a VTV (Vilafranqu√≠ de Tota la Vida). 
- Well this is a little fun project to do to test your VTV knowledge. It contains silly questions about old street names, which day of the year some local folklore takes place, etc etc.
- It has 2 levels: easy and difficult. The difficult one is very difficult, it has been crafted by my parents..
- It features a funkly looking image of the local "geganta".
- Built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

Enjoy!
